            <p>It's revolutionised Money as we know it.</p>
            <p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until <time datetime="01/12/2010">December 2010</time>. Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Nakamoto.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics and identity</h2>
            <p>Nakamoto has never revealed personal information when discussing technical matters, though has at times provided commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan; however, some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English.</p>
