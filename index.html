            <p>It's revolutionised Money as we know it.</p>
            <p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. <br><br> As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until <time datetime="01/12/2010">December 2010.</time> Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Nakamoto.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics and identity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Nakamoto has never revealed personal information when discussing technical matters, though has at times provided commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. <br><br> On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan; however, some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English.</p>
